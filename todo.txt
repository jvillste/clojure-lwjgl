everything is just composable functions

component state is function of application state
visual elements are functions of component state
styles are functions of visual elements
event handlers are functions over input state, visual elements, component state and application state
layouts are functions over visuals
animations are functions over visuals and time


component state = data binding(application state)
component state = event handlers(input state, component state)
visual elements = template(component state)
visual elements = style(visual elements)
visual elements = layout(visual elements)
visual elements = animations(visual elements, time)

  (apply-styles (styles))
  (measure-layout (is-layout-expired))
  (layout (is-layout-expired))

every application can have different set of components, visual elements, layouts, styles and animations.
